# Ride-Sharing
Project Outline: On-Demand Ride-Sharing Platform

Core Features

1. User and Driver Registration/Login: Basic authentication and role differentiation.


2. Request Ride: Users can request rides by providing pickup and drop-off locations.


3. Match Driver with Ride: System matches a nearby driver to the user’s ride request.


4. Track Ride: Allows users to see driver’s location in real-time once the ride is accepted.


5. Fare Calculation: Calculates the fare based on distance or fixed pricing.



Suggested Tech Stack

Backend: Spring Boot

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for user and ride data

APIs: Google Maps API for routing and distance calculation

Real-Time Communication: WebSocket for 

Initialize the Spring Boot project.

Set up database tables for User, Driver, and Ride.

Configure basic authentication and role-based access control for users and drivers.


User and Driver Registration API: Endpoints for creating user/driver accounts with role differentiation.

Login API: Set up JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints.

Profile Management: Basic endpoints to update user and driver profiles.



Request Ride API: Endpoint where users provide pickup and drop-off locations.

Driver Matching Algorithm: Implement a basic algorithm to find nearby drivers (mocked or simplified for this version).

Ride Assignment: Once matched, update ride status and notify the driver.


 Real-Time Tracking and Status Update

Location Tracking: Integrate Google Maps API to retrieve driver routes.

WebSocket for Real-Time Updates: Implement WebSocket connections for live location tracking of the driver.

Ride Status API: Update ride status (e.g., waiting, in-progress, completed).


Fare Calculation API: Use Google Maps API distance calculation to estimate 



Notification System: Implement notifications to alert users about ride status updates via email/SMS (using a service like Twilio).


Testing: Test each endpoint for functionality and security. Include unit and integration tests.

Documentation: Create API documentation using Swagger or Spring REST Docs.



Core API Endpoints

1. User and Driver Registration

POST /register - Register a new user or driver.

POST /login - User/driver login.



2. Ride Request and Management

POST /ride/request - Request a ride with pickup/drop-off.

GET /ride/track/{rideId} - Track driver’s location (via WebSocket).

PUT /ride/complete/{rideId} - Mark ride as completed and process fare.



3. Driver Matching and Notifications

POST /driver/match/{rideId} - Find nearest driver for the ride.

POST /notify/{userId} - Notify users of ride updates.
